A Homestuck mod for Minecraft
As of right now, very little is available, but the plan is for this mod to be an (almost) true SBURB simulation mod for Minecraft. There will be things that may not ever be implemented (time travel and the Horrorterrors, for instance), but we will find ways to make compromises.

UPCOMING FEATURES:

As we're still pretty much setting up, just about anything can be considered upcoming unless otherwise stated. As of right now, the plan for the first big fatherdump of features includes:
New items
New blocks
New mobs (lusii, Underlings, First Guardians, consorts, and Denizens for now)
Pre-generated Land dimensions
Randomized God Tier titles (they probably won't actually do anything for a while except generate a Land for you out of a small set selection of Lands generated specifically for that Aspect)
Planet quests
New weapons! Always weapons
And probably a bit more!*

*This is always subject to change, as plans can change in the blink of an eye. The case most likely related to a change of plans would be severe coding errors or a lack of extra hands. And arms. And bodies. Intelligent bodies.
